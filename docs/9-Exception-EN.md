## Specified access key is not found

Reasons and solutions:

 1. Ak doesn't have permission, contact the administrator to get permission
 2. Ak error, check the correctness of AK
 3. Environment mismatch, please confirm that AK is valid in the current environment
 
## Server response has a bad format type

Reasons and solutions:

The response does not specify a data format

1. `request.setAcceptFormat(FormatType.JSON)`. Add this code, if this cannot be fixed then you can use the second solution
2. `HttpResponse response = client.doAction(request)` you could use this code to receive the returned data

[Official documentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/2000/REC-xml-20001006#NT-Char)

The following three kinds of characters are illegal, please don't appear in XML

 2. 0x0b - 0x0c
 3. 0x0e - 0x1f
